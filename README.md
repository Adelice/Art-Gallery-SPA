# Art-Gallery-SPA
A web-based single-page application that displays a gallery of artworks sourced from a public art API (for example, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collections API). Users can browse artworks, filter them by medium or department, and view detailed information for each pieceâ€”all without leaving the main page.
## Key Features
- Single Page: All interaction and content changes happen on one HTML page.
- API Integration: Fetch artwork data (titles, images, mediums, artists) from a public art API.
- Filtering and Searching: Allow users to filter artworks by medium, department, or artist.
- Interactive Elements: Implement event listeners to handle user actions (e.g., selecting a filter, clicking on an artwork thumbnail to see details).
- Array Methods: Use array methods like filter() or map() to transform and display fetched data.
